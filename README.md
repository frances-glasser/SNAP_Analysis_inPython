# SNAP Analysis inPython
Simple analysis of SNAP to showcase data visualization skills from a Data Science Course: Intro to Python (2024) <br>
This analysis is a basic python analysis that features data collected from the USDA on Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). The code shows data cleaning, manipluation, exporting of files to excel, seaborn visualizations and heatmaps. I decided to study SNAP data because government data, both national and international, is of great interest to me. This was a academic project that I expanded on to practice new graphing forms and analysis. I have enjoyed the process and am open to feedback but at this time I do not have plans of expanding the code further as I'm spending my time on other projects like webscraping and this is only meant to be a basic data analysis.
